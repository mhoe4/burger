### Overview
This application is a burger logger created using with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This app follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node/MySQL to query/route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
